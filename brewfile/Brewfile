# Brewfile by Andr√© Jonas <andre.jonas@gmail.com>
#
# CAUTION: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
#
# ## Taps
#
# We do not use tap in this file; instead, we use full paths.
# This is because we want to be as clear as possible about what
# is being installed, and from what locations.
#
# ## Dupes
#
# We generaly prefer homebrew/dupes to preinstalled Mac software.
# For example, we prefer the GNU `sed` command vs. macOS `sed` command.
# However, we have seen this cause conflicts with macOS software that
# isn't aware of GNU; therefore we install the dupes in parallel.

##
# GNU command line tools
#
# If you are moving onto macOS from GNU/Linux, then you would probably
# find out that the command line tools shipped with macOS are not as
# powerful and easy to use as the tools in Linux. The reason is that
# macOS uses the BSD version command line tools, which are different
# from the Linux version.
#
# Note: if you choose to replace the macOS commands with GNU commands,
# then be aware that you may have some compatibility issues with shell
# scripts written specifically for macOS.
#
# If you like using man pages, then you may also want to add an
# itemto the to the MANPATH environmental variable:
#
#     $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman
#

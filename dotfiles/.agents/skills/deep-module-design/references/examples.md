# Deep Module Design — Extended Examples

Before/after examples for the design-time principles in `SKILL.md`. For audit-time examples (pass-through methods, temporal decomposition, information leakage in existing code), see the **complexity-red-flags** skill.

## Example 1: General-Purpose vs. Special-Purpose (Workflow step 4)

A general-purpose interface is often _simpler_ than a special-purpose one because it replaces many specific methods with fewer, more flexible ones.

### Before (Special-Purpose)

```typescript
class TextEditor {
  deleteSelection(): void { ... }
  deleteNextChar(): void { ... }
  deletePrevChar(): void { ... }
  deleteWord(): void { ... }
  deleteLine(): void { ... }
  deleteToEndOfLine(): void { ... }

  insertChar(c: string): void { ... }
  insertString(s: string): void { ... }
  insertNewline(): void { ... }
  insertTab(): void { ... }
}
```

Ten methods, each for a specific editing action. Every new editing operation requires a new method. The interface grows linearly with the feature set.

### After (General-Purpose)

```typescript
class TextEditor {
  insert(position: Position, text: string): void { ... }
  delete(start: Position, end: Position): void { ... }
  selection(): Range { ... }
  moveCursor(position: Position): void { ... }
}
```

Four methods that can express any editing operation. `deleteSelection` becomes `delete(selection.start, selection.end)`. `deleteLine` becomes `delete(lineStart, lineEnd)`. The interface is both smaller and more powerful.

**Stop point:** generality fails in two directions, both worth watching for:

- **Too low-level (under-bundled).** A common operation takes more than one primitive call to express. Add a convenience method or rebalance the boundary.
- **Too general (over-parameterized).** A single primitive grows five arguments and a flags object to cover every case. Split it back into focused primitives.

Aim for "somewhat general-purpose": general enough to absorb future variants, specific enough that the common case is one line.

## Example 2: Pull Complexity Down with Defaults (Workflow step 2)

### Before (Complexity Pushed Up to Caller)

```typescript
const client = new HttpClient({
  timeout: 30,
  retries: 3,
  retryBackoff: new ExponentialBackoff({ base: 1, max: 30 }),
  connectionPoolSize: 10,
  keepAlive: true,
  sslVerify: true,
  sslCaBundle: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt",
  followRedirects: true,
  maxRedirects: 5,
});
```

The interface exposes every implementation decision. Callers must understand connection pooling, SSL verification, backoff strategies — things they shouldn't need to care about to make a request.

### After (Complexity Pulled Down)

```typescript
// Sensible defaults for everything. Override only what you need.
const client = new HttpClient();

// Or, for the rare case where customization is real:
const client = new HttpClient({ timeout: 60, retries: 5 });
```

The constructor still accepts all those options, but defaults every single one. 95% of callers write one line. The module absorbed the complexity of knowing what good defaults look like — that knowledge belongs with the people who maintain the module, not the people who use it.

**Counter-rule:** if a caller _legitimately_ needs to make a decision (e.g., choosing between strict and lax SSL for a specific environment), keep that knob exposed. Hide implementation choices, not outcome decisions.

## Example 3: Don't Over-Decompose Utilities (Workflow step 5)

### Before (Premature Abstraction)

```typescript
// utils/string.ts — used in exactly one place
export function capitalize(s: string): string {
  return s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
}

// utils/array.ts — used in exactly one place
export function unique<T>(arr: T[]): T[] {
  return [...new Set(arr)];
}

// utils/date.ts — used in exactly one place
export function formatDate(d: Date): string {
  return d.toISOString().split("T")[0];
}
```

Three files, three functions, each used once. The "utility" abstraction isn't hiding information — it's just moving code to a different file. Callers must now find and understand the utility instead of seeing the logic inline.

### After (Inline Until Reuse Is Real)

```typescript
// Just write it where you use it
const displayName = name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
const uniqueTags = [...new Set(tags)];
const dateStr = date.toISOString().split("T")[0];
```

Three lines, no indirection. Extract into a shared utility only when you have three or more call sites, _and_ the utility provides a genuinely simpler interface than the raw operation.

---

## Example 4: Combining Closely Related Code (Workflow step 5)

The inverse of the previous example: when code shares knowledge, splitting it creates leakage.

### Before (Five Shallow Collaborators)

```typescript
class UserValidator {
  validate(input: UserInput): ValidationResult { ... }
}
class PasswordHasher {
  hash(password: string): string { ... }
}
class UserRepository {
  save(user: User): void { ... }
}
class WelcomeEmailSender {
  send(user: User): void { ... }
}
class UserRegistrationService {
  constructor(
    private validator: UserValidator,
    private hasher: PasswordHasher,
    private repo: UserRepository,
    private emailer: WelcomeEmailSender,
  ) {}

  register(input: UserInput): User {
    const result = this.validator.validate(input);
    if (!result.ok) throw new ValidationError(result.errors);
    const user = new User(input.email, this.hasher.hash(input.password));
    this.repo.save(user);
    this.emailer.send(user);
    return user;
  }
}
```

Five classes, none of which hides meaningful information. The `UserRegistrationService` is pure orchestration. Validation rules know the user shape; hashing knows the password format; storage knows the user shape; the email sender knows the user shape. The same knowledge is encoded in four places.

### After (One Deep Module)

```typescript
class Users {
  register(email: string, password: string): User {
    // Validates, hashes, stores, sends welcome — all internal.
    ...
  }

  authenticate(email: string, password: string): Session { ... }
  deactivate(userId: string): void { ... }
}
```

One class, deep interface. Validation rules, hashing strategy, storage mechanism, and email delivery are all internal. Switch from bcrypt to argon2 — nothing outside this module changes. Switch from SQL to a document store — nothing outside this module changes.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Question | Failure mode if skipped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Write the ideal call site | What capability does the module deliver, and what's the line of caller code I wish I could write? | Designing inside-out; interface shaped by the implementation |
| 2. Bury implementation decisions | Would changing this decision force callers to change? | Information leakage; every internal change ripples outward |
| 3. Make every layer earn its abstraction | Does this layer add real responsibility, or just delegate? | Pass-through layers; cognitive overhead with no benefit |
| 4. Lean general-purpose, stop at "somewhat" | Can one method replace several special-case ones without making the common case awkward? | API bloat (too special) or unusable interfaces (too general) |
| 5. Combine closely related, resist splitting unrelated | Does each piece make sense alone? Do callers always use them together? | God-modules (over-combined) or shallow collaborators (over-split) |
| 6. Verify depth | Call-site match? Concept ratio reasonable? Swap test passes? | Shipping a shallow module disguised as a deep one |
